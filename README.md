This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

## Running:

```shell
# To run, you need the hardhat.config.ts file
yarn # install the pacakages
yarn compile # compile the contracts
yarn test # run the tests, make sure dotenv is not empty
```
